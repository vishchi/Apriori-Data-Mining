# Apriori-Data-Mining

This is an academic project intended to design a miniproject by a team of 4.
We preprocess the data of a dataset with over 7000+ rows and subject it to Apriori algorithm.
After defining the frequent itemset, we define association rules based on the frequent itemset which will be useful for firms to recalibrate their business. (like after going throught his process, if we found out that if people buy bread, it is more probable that they will also buy butter. This association rule helps in increasing the sales of products that are useful to the customer as well as brings more insights to the vendor.)
